<p><strong>Welcome to our experiment! In this experiment, you will see scenes of toy characters performing actions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are interested in how you describe them, so listeners, who don't see this change, will be able to understand what is happening in the scene.</strong></p>
<p><input type="checkbox" class="obligatory"><strong>Now we will introduce you how to take part in this study. Please tick the checkboxes to indicate that you have read the instructions.</strong></p>
<p><input type="checkbox" class="obligatory"><strong>First, you will see a picture, and a sentence describing the scene. Please imagine that you have a listener, who can also see this picture. Please read the sentence aloud, and then click on the sentence. The sentence will disappear.</strong></p>
<p><input type="checkbox" class="obligatory"><strong>Then you will see another picture, in which one of the toy characters had performed an action. You will need to produce a new sentence describing the action of the character and say the sentence aloud.</strong></p>
<p><input type="checkbox" class="obligatory"><strong>Please produce the new sentence in a way that, by listening to your sentence, the imaginary listener, who cannot see the second picture, can recreate the scene by moving the toys to which s/he has physical access.</strong></p>
<p><input type="checkbox" class="obligatory"><strong>After describing the action, you will need to click on the "Proceed" button.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now let us see some examples.</strong></p>
